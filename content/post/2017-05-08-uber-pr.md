Uber in Condado is very quick. I rarely wait more than a couple minutes for a driver. This morning I had fun driver named
Nelson. He's from Puerto Rico but lived in Massachusetts for 20 years. He ased how I liked living in Puerto Rico and I said it
was great. He asked why I moved to Puerto Rico and I told him it was the tax advantages.  He said he had heard about that
and he said he was very happy people are moving to Puerto Rico.  

He also said that I should take Uber because the money stays in Puerto Rico.  If I take a Taxi then I'm giving money to the
Dominicans and they just send it back to the Dominican Republic.  I didn't know that most taxi drivers were Dominicans.  
The next time I take a taxi I'll ask the driver where he's from.falkj
