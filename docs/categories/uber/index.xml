      <description>&lt;p&gt;Uber in Condado is very quick. I rarely wait more than a couple minutes for a driver. This morning I had fun driver named
Nelson. He&amp;rsquo;s from Puerto Rico but lived in Massachusetts for 20 years. He ased how I liked living in Puerto Rico and I said it
was great. He asked why I moved to Puerto Rico and I told him it was the tax advantages.  He said he had heard about that
and he said he was very happy people are moving to Puerto Rico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also said that I should take Uber because the money stays in Puerto Rico.  If I take a Taxi then I&amp;rsquo;m giving money to the
Dominicans and they just send it back to the Dominican Republic.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t know that most taxi drivers were Dominicans.&lt;br /&gt;
The next time I take a taxi I&amp;rsquo;ll ask the driver where he&amp;rsquo;s from.falkj&lt;/p&gt;
